A project for creating, storing and installing your collection of favorite installer programs, just programs or even archives. The release includes two programs - a packer and an installer. The packer is needed to create and edit a collection. It creates a special container file, into which it then "adds" the selected files. The second program - the installer - is needed for quick access to the container file, selection of the desired "software", unpacking and installation - in fact, for further use only a "large" container file and an installer are needed. AES256_CBC encryption is supported. When creating a new container - you need to specify a special combination as a password - a string that is also programmed in the installer - this is a common password for encryption/decryption. Of course, this can be changed at will. Then you can create ROOT directories - categories in the container created or opened by the packer. In each category you can add your own "software" of your choice. 1. Set the name of the application. 2. Specify the full name of the executable file with the *.exe extension. 3. Select the folder where the program files are located (the directory with the exe file itself and possibly auxiliary files). It is advisable not to add installers whose auxiliary files are located in multi-level subdirectories - this leads to memory overflow when writing metadata. If desired, you can also add a 40x40 "logo.png" file next to the exe file of your program - then it will be displayed in the main program menu. When adding archives - when entering the name of the executable file, you must enter {_ARHIVE!_}. The default password for creating a container (for the installer) is "4b530c844e09aacca14d79edd1889d7ee277e07c". The container file name is "BP.ecof". When using the installer - temporary files (unzipped files of your program that you just opened) are stored next to the installer in the "Temp" folder. Before the first launch - create a new container with the name "BP.ecof" and set the password "4b530c844e09aacca14d79edd1889d7ee277e07c". Place it in the installer. Then you can edit it using the packer. Do not open the same container with both programs at the same time - an error may occur. An example of the location of the installer file for Java can be seen in the photo. There is a picture "logo.png".
